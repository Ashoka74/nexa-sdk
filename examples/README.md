# Examples for Nexa SDK

## Introduction
Benefits of on-device AI:
Privacy: Run inference locally on the device, ensuring no sensitive data is transmitted externally.
Cost: leverage device-based computing power to reduce server expenses
Latency: Bypass the need for server communication, enabling quick, real-time processing
Offline availability: function without requiring an internet connection.
nexa-sdk is designed to speed up developers' time to on-device AI project MVP. 
This is a collection of examples of different ways to use nexa-sdk to build on-device AI project
